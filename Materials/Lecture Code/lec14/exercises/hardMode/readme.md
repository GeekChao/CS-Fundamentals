Your task is to complete the tasks listed here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j2vivowiaZWepIjUoWj6Cx3CdJiyuYslxkg8GsT8kxM/edit#slide=id.g631db3c57_367

We provide you with non-generic versions of Vessel and VesselHelper. Your job is to make them generic so that the provided test files pass. Test files (and goals) should be done in this order:

TestGoalOne (modify Vessel only)
TestRemove (modify VesselHelper.remove only)
TestMax (modify VesselHelper.max only)
TestRatio (modify VesselHelper.remove only)

All code should compile without warnings.

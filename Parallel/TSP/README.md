#Traveling salesperson problem

##Overview:
  Traveling salesperson problem is an NP-Complete problem. There are a number of intelligent solutions, but I am going to use a simple form of tree search to find a minimum-cost tour. Moreover, I implement the tree search in Pthreads. After that, I will compare the performance between serial and parallel implementation.
